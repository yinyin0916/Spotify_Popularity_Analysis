# Spotify_Popularity_Analysis

This project investigate popularity of 5k songs from Spotify using song's features. We first explored the popularity trend with respect to selective features. Then, several machine learning models were conducted to study popularity of songs, which include Linear Regression, Lasso Regression, PCA, Kmeans, Logistic Regression, SVM, Neural Network, and collaborative filtering.

## Roadmap

- Spotify_Popularity_Analysis.ipynb: code for exploratory data analysis, and machine learning models to predict/classify ratings
- Spotify_Popularity_Analysis.pdf: report that discusses the methods, models, and analysis
